Reflect on how your strategy could have been improved, or did you use a strategy
to begin with? There are a few techniques that can minimize your time for this
puzzle. That includes:

1. Remembering which switch toggles what range
2. When a few lights are left to be switched on, only fiddling and toggling
   those that affect those lights
3. A switch which toggles a large range might still be needed to fix a few
   lights, so don't hesitate to toggle them
