As a human, here were some strategies you might have used:

1. Remembering which switch toggles what range
2. When a few lights are left to be switched on, only fiddling and toggling
   those that affect those lights
3. A switch which toggles a large range might still be needed to fix a few
   lights, so don't hesitate to toggle them

However, what sort algorithm (i.e. process) would a computer use to solve this
problem?

Extension question:

-   What is the minimum number of switch operations needed to turn all the
    lights on in the worst case scenario (i.e. you get extremely unlucky)?
