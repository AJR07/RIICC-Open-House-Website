Reflect on the process which you used to solve the maze.

As a human being, here are some strategies you may have used:

    1. Generally move towards the exit.
    2. Avoid going back to places you've already been.
    3. Do not be afraid to backtrack if you get stuck.
    4. You can initially use your eyes to trace the path, it could be more efficient
    5. You could try to go from the exit to the start instead if you get stuck.

But, how would a **computer** find it's way to the exit? (answer: _Breadth First
Search_) How would you even represent such a maze in code? Feel free to approach
us if you'd like to find out more!

Extension questions:

-   How do you find the **shortest** possible path?
-   What sort of algorithm (i.e.process) was used to generate this random maze
    in the first place?
